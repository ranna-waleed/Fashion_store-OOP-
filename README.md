# Online Shopping Store – C++ OOP Project
A fully functional Online Fashion Shopping Store developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The application provides both Customer and Admin functionalities, simulating real-world e-commerce systems with features like product browsing, cart management, order processing, promotions, inventory, and reporting.

#  Problem Statement

# Proposed Solution
- The Online Shopping Store allows users to:

Shop from a wide variety of clothing and accessories.
Manage wishlists and carts.
Apply promotions.
Track orders.
View order receipts and provide reviews.

- Admins can:
Add, update, and remove products.
Monitor inventory and promotions.
Generate and filter sales reports.

# Classes Used
The system uses C++ classes to model the store’s functionality:
